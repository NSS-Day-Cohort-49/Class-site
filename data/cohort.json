I was inspired to pursue learning software development when our school district had a coding initiative that taught students and teachers the basics of coding. Once I finished the few rudimentary exercises they had for us, I was hooked. I ate up everything related to software and web development. So much so that I decided to make a career change to become a software developer.</p><p>I chose to go to Nashville Software School because of their strong track record of success and the 6 month time table was ideal for my situation. During my time at NSS I have had the opportunity to develop software in several languages such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, C#, .NET, and SQL. I am on track to graduate from NSS on March 23, 2018. I am looking for a junior software development job in the Nashville area. I have a passion for software development and a love of learning. I am a driven individual who doesn’t give up until the job is done.</p>",
